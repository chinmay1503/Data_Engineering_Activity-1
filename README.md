# Data_Engineering_Activity-1
This repo contains code written for the Assignment 1 for the course CS-510: Data Engineering taught by Professor Bruce Irvin at Portland State University 

## Data Gathering Activity

The first activity is related to Data Gathering, transformation and visualization.

In this activity we perform:
- Data extraction from the web using Python's Beautiful Soup module
- Data transformation using Python's Pandas library
- Data visualization using Python's Matplotlib library

For this lab we use data from a 10K road race that took place in Hillsboro, OR on June 2017. Specifically, you will analyze the performance of the 10K runners and answer questions such as:
- What was the average finish time for the runners?
- Did the runners' finish times follow a normal distribution?
- Were there any performance differences between males and females of various age groups?

## Outputs:
